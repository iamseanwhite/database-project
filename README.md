The database models the usage of social media among businesses. Tracking content
creation trends gives insight into product marketing and the way a business chooses to expose
and present itself to the public. Additionally, aggregating all content from each of a given
businessâ€™ social media outlets into one page allows a user to consume all forms and formats of
content without having to navigate to them separately. The database archives a business, the
social media platforms that they employ, the posts and type of content in those posts that the
business creates, as well the user feedback generated from a given platform.
